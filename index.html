            <p>Designed 9 individual interactive modules using Articulate Storyline 360. Discussed with the interdisciplinary stakeholders regarding expectations and goals, and seek for for feedback throughout the building phase. Went through multiple variations of the design, and had a three step feedback process to solidify the interaction design(individual- team- stakeholders). Assisted the Learning and Development team with smaller projects on the side of the e-leaning module design project; such as brochure design, poster design, to a T-shirt design project with the Health& Safety department.</p>
